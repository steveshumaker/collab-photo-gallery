# WEEKEND REACT PHOTO GALLERY

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This project demonstrates a simple photo gallery with the ability for a user to add a picture to the gallery, delete a picture from a gallery, and 'like' a picture (with the number of likes displayed to the user). The app uses PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node and is styled with Material UI.


## Installation

1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `tables.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!
